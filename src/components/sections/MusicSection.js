          <h1>Musical Compositions</h1>
        <p>I love music! Whether it is listening to music while I work, 
          playing as a percussionist in my highschool band, improvising on my piano at home, 
          or composing my next musical pieceâ€”music is more than just a hobby to me. 
          It is how I relax, how I stay motivated, and how I express my creativity!

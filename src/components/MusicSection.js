      <h1>Musical Compositions</h1>
        <p>I love music! Whether it is listening to music while I work, 
          playing as a percussionist in my highschool band, improvising on my piano at home, 
          or composing my next musical pieceâ€”music is more than just a hobby to me. 
          It is how I relax, how I stay motivated, and how I express my creativity! Below is one of my most recent musical compositions titled <a href="https://musescore.com/user/9899696/scores/6208985/s/2GjHVH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"Chromatic Fur Elise"</a>.
          You can check out the rest of my compositions and arrangements on my musescore profile: <a href="https://musescore.com/user/9899696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ansonjwhe</a>
